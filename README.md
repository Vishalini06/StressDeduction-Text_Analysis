# StressDeduction-Text_Analysis

📜 Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to analyze text data and determine whether the content indicates stress or not stress. The dataset contains labeled text, and the goal is to clean the data, build a predictive model, and accurately classify stress levels in text.

🚀 Features
Text Preprocessing:
Converts all text to lowercase.
Removes punctuation, special characters, and numbers.
Removes stopwords (common words like "the", "is") to focus on meaningful words.
Applies stemming to reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" → "run").
Machine Learning:
A classifier is trained to predict stress (1) or not stress (0) based on cleaned text.
Visualization:
Displays data distribution and insights using graphs and plots.
Simple and Extendable:
Modular code allows for easy improvements, such as adding advanced models or datasets.
🧰 Technologies Used
The following tools and libraries are used in this project:

Python: Core programming language.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for running code and visualizing outputs.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Text preprocessing (stopword removal, stemming, etc.).
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model building and evaluation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization and plotting.
📊 Dataset
The dataset file is named stress.csv and contains:
Text: Raw text sentences or paragraphs.
Label: Target column with binary values:
1 → Stress
0 → Not Stress
Confidence (optional): Indicates the confidence level of labeling.
Example rows from the dataset:

Text	Label	Confidence
"I'm very worried about my exams."	1	0.95
"Feeling great and relaxed today."	0	0.90
⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stress-detection.git
cd stress-detection
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
🧑‍💻 Usage
Load the dataset:
Open main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run the initial cells to load and display the dataset.

Text Preprocessing:

The clean_text function processes raw text by:
Converting to lowercase.
Removing punctuation and stopwords.
Applying stemming to words.
Train the Model:

The processed text is fed into a machine learning model to train it for classification.
Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to predict stress levels for new sentences.
Example:
python
Copy code
model.predict(["I'm under a lot of pressure."])
📈 Results
After preprocessing and training, the model successfully classifies sentences as:

Stress: Texts indicating stress (e.g., anxiety, worry).
Not Stress: Texts without stress indicators (e.g., happy, relaxed moods).
Performance Metrics:
The model's accuracy, precision, and recall are evaluated using a test set. Results are displayed through confusion matrices and evaluation scores.

📊 Sample Output
Input Sentence	Predicted Label
"I am feeling very stressed today."	Stress
"It is a beautiful day outside."	Not Stress
